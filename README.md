# Emotion-LoRA
This repository leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune large-scale image generation models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, Flux) for producing images with targeted emotional content. It explores the correlation between AI-generated image features and human emotional responses, bridging advances in machine learning with behavioral science.
